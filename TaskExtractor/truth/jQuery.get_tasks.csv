"This is a shorthand Ajax function, which is equivalent to:",
"The success callback function is passed the returned data, which will be an XML root element, text string, JavaScript file, or JSON object, depending on the MIME type of the response. It is also passed the text status of the response.",
"As of jQuery 1.5, the success callback function is also passed a jqXHR object (in jQuery 1.4, it was passed the XMLHttpRequest object). However, since JSONP and cross-domain GET requests do not use XHR, in those cases the jqXHR and textStatus parameters passed to the success callback are undefined.",
Most implementations will specify a success handler:,
This example fetches the requested HTML snippet and inserts it on the page.,
"As of jQuery 1.5, all of jQuery's Ajax methods return a superset of the XMLHTTPRequest object. This jQuery XHR object, or jqXHR, returned by $.get() implements the Promise interface, giving it all the properties, methods, and behavior of a Promise (see Deferred object for more information). The jqXHR.done() (for success), jqXHR.fail() (for error), and jqXHR.always() (for completion, whether success or error; added in jQuery 1.6) methods take a function argument that is called when the request terminates. For information about the arguments this function receives, see the jqXHR Object section of the $.ajax() documentation.",
"The Promise interface also allows jQuery's Ajax methods, including $.get(), to chain multiple .done(), .fail(), and .always() callbacks on a single request, and even to assign these callbacks after the request may have completed. If the request is already complete, the callback is fired immediately.",Chain multiple callbacks on a single request
"The jqXHR.success(), jqXHR.error(), and jqXHR.complete() callback methods are removed as of jQuery 3.0. You can use jqXHR.done(), jqXHR.fail(), and jqXHR.always() instead.",
