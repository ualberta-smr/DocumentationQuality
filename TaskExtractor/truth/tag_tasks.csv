"""Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) largely used to assign the correct label sequence to sequential data or assess the probability of a given label and data sequence. These models are finite state machines characterised by a number of states, transitions between these states, and output symbols emitted while in each state. The HMM is an extension to the Markov chain, where each state corresponds deterministically to a given event. In the HMM the observation is a probabilistic function of the state. HMMs share the Markov chain’s assumption, being that the probability of transition from one state to another only depends on the current state - i.e. the series of states that led to the current state are not used. They are also time invariant.""",
"""The HMM is a directed graph, with probability weighted edges (representing the probability of a transition between the source and sink states) where each vertex emits an output symbol when entered. The symbol (or observation) is non-deterministically generated. For this reason, knowing that a sequence of output observations was generated by a given HMM does not mean that the corresponding sequence of states (and what the current state is) is known. This is the ‘hidden’ in the hidden markov model.""",

"""To ground this discussion, take a common NLP application, part-of-speech (POS) tagging. An HMM is desirable for this task as the highest probability tag sequence can be calculated for a given sequence of word forms. This differs from other tagging techniques which often tag each word individually, seeking to optimise each individual tagging greedily without regard to the optimal combination of tags for a larger unit, such as a sentence. The HMM does this with the Viterbi algorithm, which efficiently computes the optimal path through the graph given the sequence of words forms.""",
"""In POS tagging the states usually have a 1:1 correspondence with the tag alphabet - i.e. each state represents a single tag. The output observation alphabet is the set of word forms (the lexicon), and the remaining three parameters are derived by a training regime. With this information the probability of a given sentence can be easily derived, by simply summing the probability of each distinct path through the model. Similarly, the highest probability tagging sequence can be derived with the Viterbi algorithm, yielding a state sequence which can be mapped into a tag sequence.""",

TnT - Statistical POS tagger,
IMPORTANT NOTES:,
DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY DEAL WITH UNSEEN WORDS,
"""It is possible to provide an untrained POS tagger to create tags for unknown words, see __init__ function""",
SHOULD BE USED WITH SENTENCE-DELIMITED INPUT,
"""Due to the nature of this tagger, it works best when trained over sentence delimited input.""",
"""However it still produces good results if the training data and testing data are separated on all punctuation eg: [,.?!]""",
"""Input for training is expected to be a list of sentences where each sentence is a list of (word, tag) tuples""",
Input for tag function is a single sentence Input for tagdata function is a list of sentences Output is of a similar form,
Function provided to process text that is unsegmented,
Please see basic_sent_chop(),
"""TnT uses a second order Markov model to produce tags for a sequence of input, specifically:""",
"""argmax [Proj(P(t_i|t_i-1,t_i-2)P(w_i|t_i))] P(t_T+1 | t_T)""",
IE: the maximum projection of a set of probabilities,
The set of possible tags for a given word is derived from the training data. It is the set of all tags that exact word has been assigned.,
"""To speed up and get more precision, we can use log addition to instead multiplication, specifically:""",
log(P(t_T+1|t_T)),
"""The probability of a tag for a given word is the linear interpolation of 3 markov models; a zero-order, first-order, and a second order model.""",
"""l3*P(t_i| t_i-1, t_i-2)""",
A beam search is used to limit the memory usage of the algorithm. The degree of the beam can be changed using N in the initialization. N represents the maximum number of possible solutions to maintain while tagging.,
It is possible to differentiate the tags which are assigned to capitalized words. However this does not result in a significant gain in the accuracy of the results.,

Basic method for tokenizing input into sentences for this tagger:,

raw (bool) – boolean flag marking the input data as a list of words or a list of tagged words,
list of sentences sentences are a list of tokens tokens are the same as the input,
Function takes a list of tokens and separates the tokens into lists where each list represents a sentence fragment This function can separate both tagged and raw sequences into basic sentences.,
"""Sentence markers are the set of [,.!?]""",
This is a simple method which enhances the performance of the TnT tagger. Better sentence tokenization will further enhance the results.,
