"Note: Stanford CoreNLP v.3.5+ requires Java 8, but works with Java 9/10/11 as well. If using Java 9/10/11, you need to add this Java flag to avoid errors (a CoreNLP library dependency uses the JAXB module that was deleted from the default libraries for Java 9+):",--add-modules java.se.ee,--add-modules java.se.ee,100
The minimal command to run Stanford CoreNLP from the command line is:,"java -cp ""*"" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.stanfordcorenlp -file input.txt","java -cp ""*"" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.stanfordcorenlp -file input.txt",100
"Your command line has to load the code, libraries, and model jars that CoreNLP uses. These are all contained in JAR files (compressed archives with extension “.jar”) which come in the CoreNLP download or which can be downloaded on demand from Maven Central. The easiest way to make them available is with a command line like this, where /Users/me/corenlp/ should be changed to the path where you put CoreNLP:","java -cp ""/users/me/corenlp/*"" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.stanfordcorenlp -file inputfile","java -cp ""/users/me/corenlp/*"" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.stanfordcorenlp -file inputfile",100
"The “*” (which must be enclosed in quotes) says to add all JAR files in the given directory to the classpath. You can also individually specify the needed jar files. Use the following sort of command line, adjusting the JAR file date extensions VV to your downloaded release.",java -cp stanford-corenlp-vv.jar:stanford-corenlp-vv-models.jar:xom.jar:joda-time.jar:jollyday.jar:ejml-vv.jar -xmx2g edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.stanfordcorenlp -file inputfile,java -cp stanford-corenlp-vv.jar:stanford-corenlp-vv-models.jar:xom.jar:joda-time.jar:jollyday.jar:ejml-vv.jar -xmx2g edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.stanfordcorenlp -file inputfile,100
"To use the properties in the properties file sampleProps.properties, you give a command as follows:","java -cp ""*"" -xmx2g edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.stanfordcorenlp -props sampleprops.properties","java -cp ""*"" -xmx2g edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.stanfordcorenlp -props sampleprops.properties",100
"However, if you just want to specify a few properties, you can instead place them on the command line. For example, we can specify annotators and the output format with:","java -cp ""*"" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.stanfordcorenlp -annotators tokenize,ssplit -file input.txt -outputformat conll -output.columns word","java -cp ""*"" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.stanfordcorenlp -annotators tokenize,ssplit -file input.txt -outputformat conll -output.columns word",100
"If you have a lot of text but all you want to do is to, say, get part-of-speech (POS) tags, then you should definitely specify an annotators list, as above, since you can then omit later annotators which invoke much more expensive processing that you don’t need. For example, you might give the command:","java -cp ""*"" -xmx500m edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.stanfordcorenlp -annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos -file wikipedia.txt -outputformat conll","java -cp ""*"" -xmx500m edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.stanfordcorenlp -annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos -file wikipedia.txt -outputformat conll",100
"If you have a lot of text but all you want to do is to, say, get part-of-speech (POS) tags, then you should definitely specify an annotators list, as above, since you can then omit later annotators which invoke much more expensive processing that you don’t need. For example, you might give the command:","java -cp ""*"" -xmx500m edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.stanfordcorenlp -annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos -file wikipedia.txt -outputformat conll","./corenlp.sh -annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos -file wikipedia.txt -outputformat conll",94
"You first have to have available a models jar file for the language you wish to use. You can download it from this site or you can use the models file on Maven Central. If using Maven, you add it to your pom file like this:","<dependency>
    <groupid>edu.stanford.nlp</groupid>
    <artifactid>stanford-corenlp</artifactid>
    <version>3.9.1</version>
    <classifier>models-chinese</classifier>
</dependency>
","edu.stanford.nlp
stanford-corenlp
3.9.1
models-chinese",57
"Our examples assume that you are in the root directory of CoreNLP and that these extra jar files are also available there. Each language jar contains a default properties file for the appropriate language. Working with text in another language is then as easy as specifying this properties file. For example, for Chinese:","java -mx3g -cp ""*"" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.stanfordcorenlp -props stanfordcorenlp-chinese.properties -file chinese.txt -outputformat text","java -mx3g -cp ""*"" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.stanfordcorenlp -props stanfordcorenlp-chinese.properties -file chinese.txt -outputformat text",100
You can as usual specify details on the annotators and properties:,"java -mx1g -cp ""*"" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.stanfordcorenlp -props stanfordcorenlp-french.properties -annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,depparse -file french.txt -outputformat conllu","java -mx1g -cp ""*"" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.stanfordcorenlp -props stanfordcorenlp-french.properties -annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,depparse -file french.txt -outputformat conllu",100
"To process one file, use the -file option followed by a filename. To process a list of files, use the -fileList parameter:","java -cp ""*"" -xmx2g edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.stanfordcorenlp [ -props myprops.props ] -filelist filelist.txt","java -cp ""*"" -xmx2g edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.stanfordcorenlp [ -props myprops.props ] -filelist filelist.txt",100
