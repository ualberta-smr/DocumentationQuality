"Before using Stanford CoreNLP, it is usual to create a configuration file (a Java Properties file). Minimally, this file should contain the “annotators” property, which contains a comma-separated list of Annotators to use.

You can change the encoding used by supplying the program with the command line flag -encoding FOO (or including the corresponding property in a properties file that you are using).
