CoreNLP’s default character encoding is Unicode’s UTF-8. You can change the encoding used by supplying the program with the command line flag -encoding FOO (or including the corresponding property in a properties file that you are using). We’ve done a lot of careful work to make sure CoreNLP works with any character encoding supported by Java. Want to use ISO-8859-15 or GB18030? Be our guest!,change encoding,change encoding,100
