"Recognizes named entities (person and company names, etc.) in text. Principally, this annotator uses one or more machine learning sequence models to label entities, but it may also call specialist rule-based components, such as for labeling and interpreting times and dates. Numerical entities that require normalization, e.g., dates, have their normalized value stored in NormalizedNamedEntityTagAnnotation. For more extensive support for rule-based NER, you may also want to look at the RegexNER annotator. The set of entities recognized is language-dependent, and the recognized set of entities is frequently more limited for other languages than what is described below for English. As the name “NERClassifierCombiner” implies, commonly this annotator will run several named entity recognizers and then combine their results but it can run just a single annotator or only rule-based quantity NER.","use specialist rule

"For English, by default, this annotator recognizes named (PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, MISC), numerical (MONEY, NUMBER, ORDINAL, PERCENT), and temporal (DATE, TIME, DURATION, SET) entities (12 classes). Adding the regexner annotator and using the supplied RegexNER pattern files adds support for the fine-grained and additional entity classes EMAIL, URL, CITY, STATE_OR_PROVINCE, COUNTRY, NATIONALITY, RELIGION, (job) TITLE, IDEOLOGY, CRIMINAL_CHARGE, CAUSE_OF_DEATH, (Twitter, etc.) HANDLE (12 classes) for a total of 24 classes. Named entities are recognized using a combination of three CRF sequence taggers trained on various corpora, including CoNLL, ACE, MUC, and ERE corpora.

"At this point, a series of rules used for the KBP 2017 competition will be run to create more fine-grained NER tags. These rules are applied using a TokensRegexNERAnnotator sub-annotator. That is the main NERCombinerAnnotator builds a TokensRegexNERAnnotator as a sub-annotator and runs it on all sentences as part of it’s entire tagging process. The purpose of these rules is give tokens more specific tags. So for instance California would be tagged as a STATE_OR_PROVINCE rather than just a LOCATION.","create more fine-grained ner tags

"If you want to set global settings that will apply for all rules files, remember to use ner.fine.regexner.ignorecase and ner.fine.regexner.validpospattern.

This second TokensRegexNERAnnotator sub-annotator has the name ner.additional.regexner and is customized in the same manner. This is for the case when users want to run their own rules after the standard rules we provide.,"customize second tokensregexnerannotator sub-annotator

There a variety of ways to customize an NER pipeline. Below are some example commands.,customize ner pipeline,customize ner pipeline,100
"Stanford CoreNLP includes SUTime, Stanford’s temporal expression recognizer. SUTime is transparently called from the “ner” annotator, so no configuration is necessary. Furthermore, the “cleanxml” annotator can extract the reference date for a given XML document, so relative dates, e.g., “yesterday”, are transparently normalized with no configuration necessary.","incluce sutime
","include sutime
call  from ner annotator",93
"SUTime supports the same annotations as before, i.e., NamedEntityTagAnnotation is set with the label of the numeric entity (DATE, TIME, DURATION, MONEY, PERCENT, or NUMBER) and NormalizedNamedEntityTagAnnotation is set to the value of the normalized temporal expression.","set namedentitytagannotation with label
set normalizednamedentitytagannotation to value","support same annotations
set namedentitytagannotation with label
set normalizednamedentitytagannotation to value",100
"Also, SUTime sets the TimexAnnotation key to an edu.stanford.nlp.time.Timex object, which contains the complete list of TIMEX3 fields for the corresponding expressions, such as “val”, “alt_val”, “type”, “tid”. This might be useful to developers interested in recovering complete TIMEX3 expressions.",set timexannotation key to edu.stanford.nlp.time.timex object,set timexannotation key to edu.stanford.nlp.time.timex object,100
"Reference dates are by default extracted from the “datetime” and “date” tags in an xml document. To set a different set of tags to use, use the clean.datetags property. When using the API, reference dates can be added to an Annotation via edu.stanford.nlp.ling.CoreAnnotations.DocDateAnnotation, although note that when processing an xml document, the cleanxml annotator will overwrite the DocDateAnnotation if “datetime” or “date” are specified in the document.","set different set of tags

The DocDateAnnotator provides a variety of options for setting the document date. The ner annotator will run this annotator as a sub-annotator. These can be specified by setting properties for the ner.docdate sub-annotator.,"provide variety of options

The following example shows how to access label confidences for tokens and entities. Each token stores the probability of its NER label given by the CRF that was used to assign the label in the CoreAnnotations.NamedEntityTagProbsAnnotation.class. Each entity mention contains the probability of the token with the lowest label probability in its span. For example if Los Angeles had the following probabilities:,"access label confidences for tokens
access label confidences for entities
store probability of ner label
use crf","access label confidences for tokens
access label confidences for entities
store probability of ner label
assign label in coreannotations.namedentitytagprobsannotation.class
use crf",96
Below is code for accessing these confidences.,access confidences,access confidences,100
