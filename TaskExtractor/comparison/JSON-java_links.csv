Build the class files from the package root directory src/main/java,javac org/json/*.java
Create the jar file in the current directory,jar cf json-java.jar org/json/*.class
Compile a program that uses the jar (see example code below),javac -cp .;json-java.jar test.java 
Test file contents,"import org.json.jsonobject;
