"As of jQuery 1.5, all of jQuery's Ajax methods return a superset of the XMLHTTPRequest object. This jQuery XHR object, or ""jqXHR,"" returned by $.get() implements the Promise interface, giving it all the properties, methods, and behavior of a Promise (see Deferred object for more information). The jqXHR.done() (for success), jqXHR.fail() (for error), and jqXHR.always() (for completion, whether success or error; added in jQuery 1.6) methods take a function argument that is called when the request terminates. For information about the arguments this function receives, see the jqXHR Object section of the $.ajax() documentation.","return superset of XMLHTTPRequest object,implement Promise interface,call function argument,receive  for information"
"The Promise interface also allows jQuery's Ajax methods, including $.get(), to chain multiple .done(), .fail(), and .always() callbacks on a single request, and even to assign these callbacks after the request may have completed. If the request is already complete, the callback is fired immediately.",assign callbacks after request
