"Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) largely used to assign the correct label sequence to sequential data or assess the probability of a given label and data sequence. These models are finite state machines characterised by a number of states, transitions between these states, and output symbols emitted while in each state. The HMM is an extension to the Markov chain, where each state corresponds deterministically to a given event. In the HMM the observation is a probabilistic function of the state. HMMs share the Markov chain’s assumption, being that the probability of transition from one state to another only depends on the current state - i.e. the series of states that led to the current state are not used. They are also time invariant.","assign correct label sequence to sequential data,share assumption"
"The HMM is a directed graph, with probability weighted edges (representing the probability of a transition between the source and sink states) where each vertex emits an output symbol when entered. The symbol (or observation) is non-deterministically generated. For this reason, knowing that a sequence of output observations was generated by a given HMM does not mean that the corresponding sequence of states (and what the current state is) is known. This is the ‘hidden’ in the hidden markov model.","generate symbol,generate sequence of output observations"
"To ground this discussion, take a common NLP application, part-of-speech (POS) tagging. An HMM is desirable for this task as the highest probability tag sequence can be calculated for a given sequence of word forms. This differs from other tagging techniques which often tag each word individually, seeking to optimise each individual tagging greedily without regard to the optimal combination of tags for a larger unit, such as a sentence. The HMM does this with the Viterbi algorithm, which efficiently computes the optimal path through the graph given the sequence of words forms.","calculate highest probability for given sequence,compute optimal path through graph,compute Viterbi algorithm through graph"
