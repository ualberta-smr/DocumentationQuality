"As of jQuery 1.5, all of jQuery's Ajax methods return  a superset of the XMLHTTPRequest object. This jQuery XHR object, or ""jqXHR,"" returned by $.get() implements the Promise interface, giving it all the properties, methods, and behavior of a Promise (see Deferred object for more information). The jqXHR.done() (for success), jqXHR.fail() (for error), and jqXHR.always() (for completion, whether success or error; added in jQuery 1.6) methods take a function argument that is called when the request terminates. For information about the arguments this function receives, see the jqXHR Object section of the $.ajax() documentation.","// Assign handlers immediately after making the request,// and remember the jqxhr object for this requestvar jqxhr = $.get( ""example.php"", function() {  alert( ""success"" );})  .done(function() {    alert( ""second success"" );  })  .fail(function() {    alert( ""error"" );  })  .always(function() {    alert( ""finished"" );  }); // Perform other work here ... // Set another completion function for the request abovejqxhr.always(function() {  alert( ""second finished"" );});",https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get
