"For example, code like this will create a mixed JSONArray, some items wrapped, others
not:","SomeBean[] myArr = new SomeBean[]{ new SomeBean(1), new SomeBean(2) };
// these will be wrapped
JSONArray jArr = new JSONArray(myArr);
// these will not be wrapped
jArr.putAll(new SomeBean[]{ new SomeBean(3), new SomeBean(4) });"

to look like 1 of 2 ways.","SomeBean[] myArr = new SomeBean[]{ new SomeBean(1), new SomeBean(2) };
