"The Promise interface also allows jQuery's Ajax methods, including $.get(), to chain multiple .done(), .fail(), and .always() callbacks on a single request, and even to assign these callbacks after the request may have completed. If the request is already complete, the callback is fired immediately.","// Assign handlers immediately after making the request,// and remember the jqxhr object for this requestvar jqxhr = $.get( ""example.php"", function() {  alert( ""success"" );})  .done(function() {    alert( ""second success"" );  })  .fail(function() {    alert( ""error"" );  })  .always(function() {    alert( ""finished"" );  }); // Perform other work here ... // Set another completion function for the request abovejqxhr.always(function() {  alert( ""second finished"" );});"
"Alert the results from requesting test.php (HTML or XML, depending on what was returned).","$.get( ""test.php"", function( data ) {  alert( ""Data Loaded: "" + data );});"
"Alert the results from requesting test.cgi with an additional payload of data (HTML or XML, depending on what was returned).","$.get( ""test.cgi"", { name: ""John"", time: ""2pm"" } )  .done(function( data ) {    alert( ""Data Loaded: "" + data );  });"
"Get the test.php page contents, which has been returned in json format (""John"",""time""=>""2pm"" ) ); ?>), and add it to the page.","$.get( ""test.php"", function( data ) {  $( ""body"" )    .append( ""Name: "" + data.name ) // John    .append( ""Time: "" + data.time ); //  2pm}, ""json"" );"
