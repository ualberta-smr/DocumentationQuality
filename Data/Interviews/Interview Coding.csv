the APIs that are used most frequently,Additions or improvements,Mockup suggestion,,,,
"you can also like, uh, whatever you do, Java doc or something like that, you know, document the methods and things. But we, I mean, to be honest, we never do that. Because, I mean, you, if the, if the name you use in the code are good enough, you don't need it really

"Mainly I look for the, the quality, uh, you know, uh, the design, good UI. Um, basically I, I look at the documentation, uh, um, with the same. Um, at the same way, I look at two, uh, company websites to evaluate, let's say how the busyness behind the website is, uh, um, they work well. If the website is well done. I assume that they also are good in the business. Right. I applied, let's say I applied the same technique, uh, for the documentation

",Positive mockup feedback,Mockup content,,,,
"if you use, uh, an existing model, you can just let me know which model you are using, like in this, uh, In this situation, right. If, if you, uh, came up with a formula to calculate a score, yes, I want to know, uh, I would have you to tell me, which is this, which this formula is

"what I look for first and foremost are a clean documentation, how to install it. Any kind of caveats, if any problems arise for any machines, architecture, uh, I don’t know, problems with, uh, other dependencies
",Getting started with documentation,Starting,,,,
"if I managed to install it, usually what I do, especially for open source projects is just clone the repo and run all the tests in verbose mode",Getting started with documentation,Starting,,,,
"when I'm coding, what I usually do is, uh, kind of ignore documentation if I'm kind of familiar at that point, or just go for a pinpoint in documentation",How to use documentation after familiarity,Operation,,,,
"go to the documentation slash code, whatever comes first for that particular method. But I usually don't look at the whole class, but just the small snippets
",How to use documentation after familiarity,Operation,,,,
"let's say the usage is not trivial for example, lots of parameters or whatever, or a strange return codes. And, uh, yeah, basically if I'm still not convinced on, uh, how they manage to do something, then I go deep into the code
",Negative problems in documentation,Documentation content,,,,
"Let's say that after having a rough idea about what the library is supposed to be doing, what I look is a how to install it",Getting started with documentation,Starting,,,,
"Code examples. It's, uh, I think the thing that they love to see the most meaning a description I tend to get kind of confused and let’s say usually it does not cover all the cases that may happen",Code example importance,Code example,,,,
what I would really love to have is runnable code examples,Code example importance,Code example,,,,
"wall documentation is basically a word list of methods, like, um, Javadoc documentation, when the, the real documentation is just that the stuff. Yeah. But basically they say, I usually say screw that and completely ignore it
",Negative problems in documentation,Documentation content,,,,
"I usually start with fair. Let's say 100% trust on the documentation is a up to date and correct. And whatever it is. And if I ever happened to find out that it is not the case, even for one method, then I tend to kind of ignore and, uh, started digging into the code",Documentation consistency,Up-to-dateness,,,,
"if there are, let's say. Not only textual documentation, but also for example, a links on how to use it, for example, a screencast or a blog",Code example importance,Code example,,,,
"about the license. You’re really, right. That's another thing that I really check",Positive mockup feedback,Mockup content,,,,
"I love the fact that there is the license that up there. Honestly, it's really good",Positive mockup feedback,Mockup content,,,,

And the list of tasks is something that is not really clear to me,Negative mockup feedback,Mockup incomprehension,,,,
"it's pretty cool. Honestly. I like it. I like the lesser, let's say cluttering and the happier I am",Positive mockup feedback,Mockup presentation,,,,
"API methods that’s perfect, right? Yeah. Okay. No, that makes sense. Yeah, only thing is about the, again, it's a kind of, uh, depending on the language, methods and classes and, uh, I don't know packages, let's say modules, especially in Ruby",Additions or improvements,Mockup suggestion,,,,
"The only thing is maybe to sort the list of tasks, because right now, if I were to look at it and, uh, I don't know, trying to find out exactly",Negative mockup feedback,Mockup presentation,,,,
maybe put an X or a checkmark instead,Negative mockup feedback,Mockup presentation,,,,
I kind of skim over the textual description just to get a rough understanding and then look at the code examples,Code example importance,Code example,,,,
"once they know that the, for some, for example, the role description is this one. And then I see three different cases. I tend to kind of ignore the rest of the textual description. Just look at the, what was the difference between them",How to use documentation after familiarity,Operation,,,,
"Yes, it is. And hopefully I would love to have 100, uh, every time, but yeah, it definitely is. Uh, yeah, because if there is a like one example, uh, every 30 classes, for example. Yeah. We'll look at the documentation, but, uh, let's say not expecting that much",Code example importance,Code example,,,,
"I really love the, the license because again, it's something that I always do, but I, I honestly didn't consider it in documentation, but you're completely right",Positive mockup feedback,Mockup content,,,,
"I don't want it to say kind of need to think too much about the nuance of the code inside. Just use a dirty, quick sentence and then much, uh, we fine with it
",How to use documentation after familiarity,Operation,,,,
"I don't want the lambda to be a non-readable mess that I spend them more time trying to figure out what the Lambda is doing instead of what the method is doing, or if they use something like, um, parameters like a, b i, something, a j whatever….nah",Negative problems in documentation,Code example,,,,
"but not, let's say application wise, but a kind of task wise, maybe just the general rating or similar meaning",Additions or improvements,Mockup suggestion,,,,
"An example of a poor documentation source code consistency is having no one part of documentation. That is kind of a, for example, completely, completely text with very short examples at the end, and then moving to the next section of the documentation and finding just small sentences and huge blocks of code",Negative problems in documentation,Documentation presentation,,,,
"I mean, uh, at least be consistent. So like someone coding and using sometimes camel case, sometimes a snake case with no reason at all. Just be consistent, choose one and go for it",Negative problems in documentation,Documentation presentation,,,,
"It actually has meaning if you are achieved that good level of consistency in that point of view, then it means that the information that I'm looking for, for example, when inspecting a class that will always be at the same place. So I don't have to scroll",Ease of finding information,Ease of use,,,,
"maybe the amount of documentation, but again, I wouldn't have any clue on how to possibly measure it. Sometimes short documentation is way better than a too long and too verbose or documentation. Sometimes the opposite is true",Additions or improvements,Mockup suggestion,,,,
