Methodology
First I used a Python library to extract all the paragraphs on the webpage (based on the <p> HTML tag)
Then reading the paragraph I tried to extract tasks that a developer may do
"The react page required me to look at the page itself, rather than the extracted paragraphs for me to extract all the tasks"

Task definition
I define a task as something a developer may search/look for in documentation
It is not a description of what the library is able to do
The reason for this is a developer will not know the full extent of a library when exploring the documentation. They will have some specific tasks in mind that they want to see how this library addresses them.

Updated Task definition
"A task is any usage of a library, including its API, installation instructions, and interaction with other software."

"We ignore negative verbs (e.g., do not) because it usually describes a default that will happen, rather than a task that a developer would want to do "
