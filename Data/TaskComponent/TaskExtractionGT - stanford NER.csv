"Recognizes named entities (person and company names, etc.) in text. Principally, this annotator uses one or more machine learning sequence models to label entities, but it may also call specialist rule-based components, such as for labeling and interpreting times and dates. Numerical entities that require normalization, e.g., dates, have their normalized value stored in NormalizedNamedEntityTagAnnotation. For more extensive support for rule-based NER, you may also want to look at the RegexNER annotator. The set of entities recognized is language-dependent, and the recognized set of entities is frequently more limited for other languages than what is described below for English. As the name “NERClassifierCombiner” implies, commonly this annotator will run several named entity recognizers and then combine their results but it can run just a single annotator or only rule-based quantity NER.","Label entities with machine learning, Label entities with specialist rule-based components","Use machine
