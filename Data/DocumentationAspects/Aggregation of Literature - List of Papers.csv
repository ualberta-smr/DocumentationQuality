Understanding the Requirements for Information System Documentation: An Empirical Investigation,COCS '95: Proceedings of conference on Organizational computing systems,Case study,"8 hypotheses/requirements for good documentation:
Backbone systems require more formal documentation process than non-backbone systems
Backbone systems require documents with a high degree of traceability
Out-of-house development/maintenance efforts undergo documentation processes that are more formal than those of in-house
Out-of-house developments require a high degree of traceability
In-house developments can accommodate low consistency and completeness but require accurate details
In-house development efforts require less documentation that those of out-of-house development efforts 
Users unfamiliar with similar automated systems follow a different documentation process than familiar users
Users unfamiliar with similar automated systems require documents that are more consistent, complete, and traceable ",No ,No
