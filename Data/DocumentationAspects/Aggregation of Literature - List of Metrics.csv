Clone detection,A metrics-Based Approach to Technical Documentation Quality,Presentation Quality,Clone detection (Redundancy),2,2,2,Medium,"Can use a clone detection tool, but we need to research which clone detection tool we want to use."
Test coverage,A metrics-Based Approach to Technical Documentation Quality,,Test coverage,1,1,3,Hard,How much of the documentation does a user need to read to accomplish a task? They say it can be done automatically but I do not know how.
Clone detection,A Visualization-based Approach to Technical Documentation Quality,,Usage analysis ,1,1,1,Hard,Can only get this by keeping track of usages over time.
Usage analysis,A Visualization-based Approach to Technical Documentation Quality,Presentation Quality,Structure/Organization,3,5,4,Hard,"How do we rate what is ""Good"" or ""Bad"" structure of the documentation?  (Evaluating the Quality of the Documentation of Open Source Software has a bunch of equations)"
Structure analysis,A Visualization-based Approach to Technical Documentation Quality,,Meta-information analysis,1,1,2,Easy?,"data types, database rules, schemata, conventions, and
search tags etc."
Meta-information analysis,A Visualization-based Approach to Technical Documentation Quality,Content Quality,Usefulness,1,1,3,Hard,"How do we measure usefulness?
""Usefulness as a Measure of Recency, Frequency and Feedback"" from one reference. "
Usefulness,Software Documentation - Building and Maintaining Artefacts of Comunication,Presentation Quality,Ease of use,1,1,,,
Referential Decay,Software Documentation - Building and Maintaining Artefacts of Comunication,Content Quality,Referential Decay/Up-to-dateness,3,3,4,Easy,Do we need both referential decay and up-to-dateness? They are similar
Authority,Software Documentation - Building and Maintaining Artefacts of Comunication,,Authority,2,3,3,Hard,"One paper uses ""Kleinbergâ€™s authoritative ranking technique"""
Content,"The Relevance of Software Documentation, Tools and Technologies: A Survey",Content Quality,Content,2,2,5,Hard,Do we just use the tools for mismatch to gauge content?
Up-to-dateness,"The Relevance of Software Documentation, Tools and Technologies: A Survey",,Availability,1,1,5,Easy,How available is the documentation. Maybe a boolean of whether or not we can find and access it
Availability,"The Relevance of Software Documentation, Tools and Technologies: A Survey",Content Quality,Examples/Diagrams,2,3,4,Medium,How many examples/diagrams are good? What about the quality of the examples themselves. A lot of bad diagrams are just noise
Use of Examples,"The Relevance of Software Documentation, Tools and Technologies: A Survey",Presentation Quality,"Readability - Sentence length, grammar, conformity to standards, etc.",2,6,4,Hard,How easy is it to understand the documentation?
Organization,"The Relevance of Software Documentation, Tools and Technologies: A Survey",Presentation Quality,File format,1,1,1,Easy,"Is it a PDF, or HTML, XML, etc.?"
Type of Document ,"The Relevance of Software Documentation, Tools and Technologies: A Survey",Content Quality,Mismatch between Source Code and Documentation,3,3,4,Medium,Can maybe use the tools already created. Maybe we can combine this with Content/Up-to-dateness?
