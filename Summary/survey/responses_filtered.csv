30,35itjweymf3u7uwsmyvwjm2xwz9o1lvb,numpy,23,1,2,1,1,3,4,3,3,4,1,None,1,numpy's documentation is large. It's possible that your crawling just didn't find relevant portions. There is no way for me to tell from the summary what your crawler actually saw.\nThere does not seem to be any relationship between the overall star summary (4/5) and the individual quality metrics (mostly 0/5).

150,5r4ylonz9dikkvs5a7d0e1iilspn6v6m,jQuery,12,1,4,2,4,4,2,2,1,2,4,readme,1,I find it difficult to understand how the metrics are actually populated: what data are they based on? How were they calculated? Based on what data? Which version of jQuery? jQuery is a very bizarre library\n\nI just find it difficult to draw a conclusion from jQuery's documentation to these metrics. since most the functionality is exposed on the $(selector) object. How are code examples extracted?
151,5r4ylonz9dikkvs5a7d0e1iilspn6v6m,Flask,12,1,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,readme,2,The Flask project starts with a tutorial that teaches you how to use it from the start up. This is a good documentation and it is unclear how these metrics account for solid tutorials. That said it's sometimes difficult to find Flask API methods and types. These metrics do not reflect many of the practical considerations of Flask's documentation quality.
166,sw7f2cgu8zlrmnynqfldfuwuk9gko6ch,numpy,3,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,readme,1,Most of the documentation quality metrics are 0 star which seems pretty strange and inaccurate to me. The documented library tasks section also seems quite limited and I feel a google search would be more effective.
