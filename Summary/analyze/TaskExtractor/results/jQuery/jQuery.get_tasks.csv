"As of jQuery 1.5, the success callback function is also passed a ""jqXHR"" object (in jQuery 1.4, it was passed the XMLHttpRequest object). However, since JSONP and cross-domain GET requests do not use XHR,  in those cases the jqXHR and textStatus parameters passed to the success callback are undefined.","pass jqxhr object

"As of jQuery 1.5, all of jQuery's Ajax methods return  a superset of the XMLHTTPRequest object. This jQuery XHR object, or ""jqXHR,"" returned by $.get() implements the Promise interface, giving it all the properties, methods, and behavior of a Promise (see Deferred object for more information). The jqXHR.done() (for success), jqXHR.fail() (for error), and jqXHR.always() (for completion, whether success or error; added in jQuery 1.6) methods take a function argument that is called when the request terminates. For information about the arguments this function receives, see the jqXHR Object section of the $.ajax() documentation.","return superset of XMLHTTPRequest object"
"The jqXHR.success(), jqXHR.error(), and jqXHR.complete() callback methods are removed as of jQuery 3.0. You can use jqXHR.done(), jqXHR.fail(), and jqXHR.always() instead.","use jqXHR.done()
