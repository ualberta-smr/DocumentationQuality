"While every annotator can technically be run as a top-level component, in some cases it makes sense for one annotator to run another as a sub-annotator. For instance the coref annotator runs the coref.mention annotator (which identifies coref mentions) as a sub-annotator by default. So instead of supplying an annotator list of tokenize,ssplit,parse,coref.mention,coref the list can just be tokenize,ssplit,parse,coref. Another example is the ner annotator running the entitymentions annotator to detect full entities. Below is a table summarizing the annotator/sub-annotator relationships that currently exist in the pipeline. By default annotators will generally run their sub-annotators.","run annotator as top-level component
run coref.mention annotator as sub-annotator
run coref.mention annotator by default
run coref.mention annotator for instance
run entitymentions annotator
summarize annotator/sub-annotator relationships
run sub-annotators by default"
