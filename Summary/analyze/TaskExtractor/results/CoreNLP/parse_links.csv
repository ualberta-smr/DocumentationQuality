"All of our parsers make use of parts of speech. Some of the models (e.g., neural dependency parser and shift-reduce parser) require an external PoS tagger; you must specify the pos annotator. Other parsers, such as the PCFG and Factored parsers can either do their own PoS tagging or use an external PoS tagger as a preprocessor. If you want to use a parser as the PoS tagger, make sure you do not include pos in the list of annotators and position the annotator parse prior to any other annotator that requires part-of-speech information (such as lemma):","-annotators tokenize,ssplit,parse,lemma,ner",https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/parse.html
