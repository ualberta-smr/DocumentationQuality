"The CorefAnnotator finds mentions of the same entity in a text, such as when “Theresa May” and “she” refer to the same person. The annotator implements both pronominal and nominal coreference resolution. The entire coreference graph (with head words of mentions as nodes) is saved as a CorefChainAnnotation.","save entire coreference graph as CorefChainAnnotation"
"Statistical: Machine-learning-based coreference resolution for English. Unlike the other systems, this one only requires dependency parses, which are faster to produce than constituency parses.","produce  than constituency parses"
"The F1 scores are on the CoNLL 2012 evaluation data. Numbers are lower than reported in the associated papers because these models are designed for general-purpose use, not getting a high CoNLL score (see Running on CoNLL 2012).","design models for general-purpose use"
"The speed measurements show the average time for processing a document in the CoNLL 2012 test set using a 2013 Macbook Pro with a 2.4 GHz Intel Core i7 processor. Preprocessing speed measures the time required for POS tagging, syntax parsing, mention detection, etc., while coref speed refers to the time spent by the coreference system.","show average time for processing

"There are example properties files for using the coreference systems in edu/stanford/nlp/coref/properties. The properties are named [system]-[language].properties. For example, to run the deterministic system on Chinese:","use coreference systems

"Alternatively, the properties can be set manually. For example, to run the neural system on English:","set properties

"The following example shows how to access coref and mention information from an Annotation:","access coref"
"This is a mention-ranking model using a large set of features. It operates by iterating through each mention in the document, possibly adding a coreference link between the current one and a preceding mention at each step. Some relevant options:","use large set of features
add coreference link between preceding mention"
"coref.maxMentionDistanceWithStringMatch: The system will consider linking the current mention to a preceding one further than coref.maxMentionDistance away if they share a noun or proper noun. In this case, it looks coref.maxMentionDistanceWithStringMatch away instead. The default value is 500.","link current mention

"coref.statisical.pairwiseScoreThresholds: A number between 0 and 1 determining how greedy the model is about making coreference decisions. A value of 0 causes the system to add no coreference links and a value of 1 causes the system to link every pair of mentions, combining them all into a single coreference cluster. The default value is 0.35. The value can also be a comma-separated list of 4 numbers, in which case there are separate thresholds for when both mentions are pronouns, only the first mention is a pronoun, only the last mention is a pronoun, and neither mention is a pronoun.","add coreference links

"To use the English deterministic system, you need to use the dcoref annotator.","use English deterministic system

"If you would like to run our statistical or neural systems on the CoNLL 2012 eval data:","run neural systems on CoNLL eval data"
"Because of this, we train models with a few extra features for running on this dataset. We configure these models for accuracy over speed (e.g., by not having a maximum mention distance for the mention-ranking models). These models can be run using the -conll properties files (e.g., neural-english-conll.properties). Note that the CoNLL-specific models for English are in the English models jar, not the default CoreNLP models jar.","run  on dataset

"As a rule-based system, there is nothing to train, but there are various data files for demonyms and to indicate noun gender, animacy, and plurality, which can be edited. See the Stanford Deterministic Coreference Resolution System page.","edit plurality"
"See here for an example properties file. Training over the full CoNLL 2012 training set requires a large amount of memory. To reduce the memory footprint and runtime of training, the following options can be added to the properties file:","add following options to properties file"
