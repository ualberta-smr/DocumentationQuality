"Multi Word Token Expansion is the process of splitting tokens into syntactic words which are used by downstream tasks such as part of speech tagging and dependency parsing. In CoreNLP, MWT expansion is only performed for French, German, and Spanish. The expansions are designed to be consistent with the UD 2.0 standard.","tag parsing

"Each language has different rules for MWT expansion. For instance consider the Spanish sentence Pude haber querido escribirlo.. This sentence contains an example of an enclitic pronoun, which is split off from the verb by MWT expansion. So escribirlo is split into escribir and lo.","split escribirlo into escribir

"In French, the word “des” is only split in certain circumstances. Thus, a statistical model is needed to make decisions on when to split “des” into “de” and “les”. First a part of speech tag model for MWT expansion is applied (mwt.pos.model). This model applies special tags to words that should be split. For French, it applies the tag “ADP_DET” to the word “des” in cases where “des” should be split. A corresponding dictionary is provided via mwt.statisticalMappingFile which maps word-tag pairs to splits. In the case of French, “des-ADP_DET” is mapped to “de,les”. Mapping files should consist of 2 tab separated columns. The first column contains the word and tag (e.g. “des-ADP_DET”), and the second column should consist of a comma separated list of multi word tokens (e.g. “de,les”).","split word des in french

"This demo code will produce this output, which shows the enclitic pronoun being split from the verb:","produce output
