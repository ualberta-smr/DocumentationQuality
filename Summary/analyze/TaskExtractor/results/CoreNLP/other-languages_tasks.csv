"Below are interfaces and packages for running Stanford CoreNLP from other languages or within other packages. They have been written by many other people (thanks!). In general you should contact these people directly if you have problems with these packages.","run Stanford CoreNLP within other packages

"Note on running the CoreNLP server under docker: The container’s port 9000 has to be published to the host. For example, give a command like: docker run -p 9000:9000 --name coreNLP --rm -i -t motiz88/corenlp. If, when going to localhost:9000/, you see the error This site can’t be reached. localhost refused to connect, then this is what you failed to do!","run CoreNLP server under docker

"And there are many others – it’s not so hard to build a dockerfile. Here are a few more:","build dockerfile"
"We are actively developing a Python package called Stanza, with state-of-the-art NLP performance enabled by deep learning. Besides, this package also includes an API for starting and making requests to a Stanford CoreNLP server. It is the recommended way to use Stanford CoreNLP in Python.","develop Python package
