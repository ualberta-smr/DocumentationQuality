I want to know if the core topic of a Stack Overflow post is a given API. I am giving two examples below.

This is a stack overflow post:
"""
'$example1'
"""

My question:
"""
Is the main topic of this post this API: '$api1'?
"""

The correct answer is '$answer1'

This is another stackoverflow post:
"""
'$example2'
"""

My question:
"""
Is the main topic of this post this API: '$api2'?
"""

The correct answer is: '$answer2'

Now, this is another Stack Overflow post:
‘$post_body’

Is the main topic of this post this API: '$api_fqn'?

Answer in yes or no
