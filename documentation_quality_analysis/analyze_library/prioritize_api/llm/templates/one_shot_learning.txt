    "content": "I want to know if the core topic of a Stack Overflow post is a given API. I am giving two examples below. \nThis is a stack overflow post:\n‘The function numpy.savez() allows to store numpy objects in a file. Storing the same same object in two files results in two different files:\n\nimport numpy as np\nsome_array = np.arange(42)\nnp.savez('/tmp/file1', some_array=some_array)\nnp.savez('/tmp/file2', some_array=some_array)\nThe two files differ:\n\n$ diff /tmp/file1.npz /tmp/file2.npz \nBinary files /tmp/file1.npz and /tmp/file2.npz differ\nWhy aren't the files identical? Is there some random behavior, filename or time stamp included? Can this be workaround or fixed? (Is it a bug?)\n\nNote that this is not the case for np.save(). Files produced by np.save() are identical for identical inputs. So I guess it is related to zipping of the data.\n\nAFAICS there are only two bits different:\n\n$ xxd /tmp/file1.npz > /tmp/file1.hex\n$ xxd /tmp/file2.npz > /tmp/file2.hex\n$ diff -u0 /tmp/file1.hex /tmp/file2.hex    \n--- /tmp/file1.hex      2018-03-13 13:39:12.235897095 +0100\n+++ /tmp/file2.hex      2018-03-13 13:39:08.743927081 +0100\n@@ -1 +1 @@\n-0000000: 504b 0304 1400 0000 0000 ce6c 6d4c 9c9d  PK.........lmL..\n+0000000: 504b 0304 1400 0000 0000 cf6c 6d4c 9c9d  PK.........lmL..\n@@ -30 +30 @@\n-00001d0: 1403 1400 0000 0000 ce6c 6d4c 9c9d 6ad9  .........lmL..j.\n+00001d0: 1403 1400 0000 0000 cf6c 6d4c 9c9d 6ad9  .........lmL..j.\nI can't find any good hint in the implementation of the function, but I haven't checked the zipping code yet (also Python 3.6 might make a difference).\n\nNote: Tested with Python 2.7 and numpy 1.9.2.\n’\n\nIs the main topic of this post this API: 'numpy.save'? \n The correct answer is 'No'\n\nThis is another stackoverflow post: \n‘numpy.unique with order preserved:\n['b','b','b','a','a','c','c']\nnumpy.unique gives\n['a','b','c']\nHow can I get the original order preserved\n['b','a','c']\n’\nIs the main topic of this post this API: 'numpy.unique? \nThe correct answer is yes\n\n Now, this is another Stack Overflow post: ‘$post_body’\nIs the main topic of this post this API: '$api_fqn'? \nAnswer in yes or no\n"},
