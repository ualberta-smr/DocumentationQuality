0,8652785,True,True,True,Why does numpy.apply_along_axis seem to be slower than Python loop?. I'm confused about when numpy's numpy.apply_along_axis() function will outperform a simple Python loop.
1,23349128,True,True,True,"I have seen a couple of codes using numpy.apply_along_axis and I always have to test the codes to see how this works 'cause I didn't understand the axis idea in Python yet. So I build an example to test how this works with an array of matrices (the problem that took me to this axis question), which can also be seen as a 3d matrix, where each row is a matrix, right?"
2,2772661,True,False,True,"I have a AxNxM numpy array data, over which I'd like to map foo to give me a resultant numpy array of length A. I've looked at numpy.vectorize, and numpy.apply_along_axis, but neither works for a function of 2D arrays."

7,49480148,True,True,False,"My question is: Is there a generic way to go about acting a function to 2D slices without having to use a loop or does it depend on how I have function defined? And if so, what would be the most efficient way of doing this?"
8,46598055,True,False,True,numpy apply_along_axis vectorisation. I am trying to implement a function that takes each row in a numpy 2d array and returns me scalar result of a certain calculations.
9,65494994,True,False,False,"The thing is that I've found different approaches to do so, but all of them apply a function over each component of a pixel, whereas what I want to do is to apply a function that receives a pixel (not a pixel component), this is, the 3 rgb components (I guess as a tuple, but I don't care about the format as long as I have the 3 components as parameters in my function). If you are interested on what I have, this is the non-efficient solution to my issue (works fine but it is too slow): I've followed this post: PIL - apply the same operation to every pixel that seemed to be pretty clear and aligned with my issue."
10,52532580,True,False,False,"Get the indices of the first and last rows and columns containing non-masked values in a numpy 2D array. With a 2D masked array in Python, what would be the best way to get the index of the first and last rows and columns containing a non-masked value?"

19,63431863,True,True,False,"What I would like to do is figure out a way to access the index of the axis being passed at each iteration. I know there are pairwise functions in scikit-learn, but please assume these do not suit my purposes (my function is more complicated than this toy one) If I were to use numpy's apply_long_axis(), I can only work out how to compare all i,j and j,i, not the smaller problem as described before."
20,49032767,True,False,False,"I want to apply a function like this: where s and x are both arrays of the same length. I haven't come across a method that applies functions to current and previous elements of an array without using for loops, and that is really what I want to understand how to do here."
21,55984973,True,True,True,"numpy.apply_along_axis truncates strings because it infers wrong dtype '<U1'.

25,43618825,True,False,True,numpy apply_along_axis with different result size. So the result is not a matrix anymore but a list of column of different length.
26,28898858,True,True,True,"If I have a function, f(x) which takes a single 1d-array as argument and produces a 1d-array as output, I can use numpy.apply_along_axis to apply the function, to each row of a 2d-array X whose rows are valid arguments for f. Now I want to do the analogous thing with a function that takes two arguments. I am also interested in variants, where f takes more arguments or higher dimensional arrays are involved: For example f could take 3 arrays x, y, z of shape (2,2); (3,); (5,) and produce a result of shape (4,4)."
